### Explanations to uMatrix Visual Elements

![](/assets/power.png) temporary power switch for current scope (creating `matrix-off: example.com true` as a temporary rule). The number at the corner means scope detected.

![](/assets/dots.png) per-scope switches for some built-in privacy tools. Go to `Settings` tab in uMatrix dashboard for global preferences. The number at the corner means activated changes for current scope.

![](/assets/lock.png) save all temporary rules and clickable only when any temporary rule ever exists. The number at the corner means the number of temporary rules about to be committed.

![](/assets/erase.png) erase all temporary rules and clickable only when any temporary rule ever exists.

![](/assets/expand.png) Click to expand or fold up all blocked hosts by built-in subscriptions (`Hosts files` tab in the dashboard). They are times when these hostnames appear out of the bottom, e.g. `pingjs.qq.com`. In those cases, they are displayed as `Permanent rules`.
