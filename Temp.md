#### Shugi shugi shugi - Some Temp. Rules

These rules should be used as temporary rules cleared as your browser closes rather than kept in uMatrix as permanent rules.
Such a behavior is suggested as these rules reserve usability on several pages while allowing tracking in very most parts on those sites.

Hint: you don't have to copy & paste them. Simply click uMatrix toolbar button and click on the corresponding square.

#### Baidu

    baidu.com fex.bdstatic.com script allow

#### Bilibili

    bilibili.com activity.hdslb.com script allow

#### SMZDM

    smzdm.com alimama.alicdn.com script allow
    smzdm.com s2.zdmimg.com script allow

#### Youku

The rules given here should work fine. If not, disable the scope & hard refresh (without cache), and enable again as soon as any video starts. Still no idea why.
