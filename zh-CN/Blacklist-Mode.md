uMatrix can be used as blacklist mode, aka allow anything despite specific classes of element you black listed.

Simply modify the rule `* * * block` into `* * * allow`.

This is, however, strongly unrecommended as:

1. losing the point of uMatrix, blocking all 3-p elements by default to enhance security & privacy.
2. much less helpful than other common content blockers.
