## Shubbanuffa - BEFORE USING

- I can only ensure most site functions are workable. Use at your own risk.
- If you are expecting my investigation on any specific site, pls open a [new issue](https://github.com/Rictusempra/uMatrix-Rules/issues/new):
    - give a specific URL
    - point out your uMatrix version & broswer version
    - attach your own rules and, if differ from default, your preferences
- Here are service inavailablity things that won't be fixed:
    -  from contents blocked by any built-in subscriptions
    - caused by certain preferences outside of rule sets or of uMatrix itself
    - if a site:
        -  is using cert from any untrusted CA
        - containing **mostly only** pornographic content
        - reported as a deceptive site
        - is a private blog site that is not hosted on public serivce
    - relevant with any plugin, such as Adobe Flash
    - other issues you should have learnt from uMatrix [README](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/blob/master/README.md) or [wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki)
